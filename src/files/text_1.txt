Python Programming: Fundamentals and Capabilities

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
This language is widely used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

Main advantages of Python:
- Simple and readable syntax
- Rich standard library
- Large developer community
- Cross-platform compatibility

Python has many modules for working with multithreading and multiprocessing.
The threading module allows creating threads for parallel task execution.
The multiprocessing module provides capabilities for creating separate processes.

Example of using threads:
import threading

def worker():
    print("Thread is working")

thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread.start()

Python is also excellent for file processing and text data handling.
With built-in functions, you can easily read, write, and process text files.
File operations are fundamental in many programming tasks and applications.
