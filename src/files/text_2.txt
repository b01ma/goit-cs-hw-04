Parallel Computing and Multithreading

In modern programming, it is very important to efficiently use computer resources.
Multithreading and multiprocessing allow executing multiple tasks simultaneously.

What is a thread?
A thread is a lightweight execution unit within a process.
Multiple threads can work in parallel within a single process.

What is a process?
A process is an independent program with its own memory space.
Processes are isolated from each other and exchange data through special mechanisms.

Differences between threading and multiprocessing:
- threading: threads share memory, created faster
- multiprocessing: processes are isolated, use all CPU cores

Python has GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which limits true thread parallelism.
Therefore, for CPU-intensive tasks, it's better to use multiprocessing.
For I/O operations (file reading, network), threading works excellently.

Synchronization between threads is achieved using:
- Lock (blocking)
- Queue (queue)
- Event (event)
- Semaphore (semaphore)

Performance optimization is crucial when dealing with large datasets and files.
