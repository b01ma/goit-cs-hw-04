Data Processing and File Search

Text data analysis is an important task in programming.
Python provides powerful tools for working with text and files.

Main file operations:
- Reading file content
- Searching for specific words or phrases
- Processing large amounts of data
- Parallel processing of multiple files

When to use parallel processing:
1. When working with a large number of files
2. When performing time-consuming operations
3. When you need to speed up the program

Keyword search algorithm:
1. Open file
2. Read content
3. Find all occurrences of keywords
4. Save results

For efficient search, you can use regular expressions (regex).
The re module in Python provides functions for working with regular expressions.

Example of word search in text:
import re

def find_keyword(text, keyword):
    pattern = r'\b' + re.escape(keyword) + r'\b'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
    return len(matches)

Search results can be collected in a dictionary or list.
It's important to properly synchronize access to shared data in multithreading.
File processing efficiency depends on the chosen approach and data structure.
